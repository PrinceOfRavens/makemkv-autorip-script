# makemkv-autorip-script
A script for automatically ripping movies and TV shows using [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/).
It has been written with the focus on parallelization, so that you can rip from multiple drives at once.

Disks will automatically be ejected once they're finished and newly inserted disks will automatically be ripped with the predefined, global parameters in the settings.cfg file.

This script was only tested on Ubuntu 20.04.01. Whilst it might work with other systems, it has not been tested on them.
